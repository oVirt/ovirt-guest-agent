Description: oVirt Guest Agent
 This is the oVirt management agent running inside the guest. The agent
 interfaces with the oVirt manager, supplying heart-beat info as well as
 run-time data from within the guest itself. The agent also accepts
 control commands to be run executed within the OS (like: shutdown and
 restart).
